# programming-language-challenge
2024 Programming Language Challenge. Each month I will undertake a short project in a new language.

# Languages and Projects

The 12 planned projects are currently as follows. As they are completed, links to the respective repositories will be added.

## 1. C#
### [unity-boid-simulator](https://github.com/ITregear/unity-boid-simulator)
![COMPLETE](https://img.shields.io/badge/-COMPLETE-green)

This is a boid simulator in 2D using Unity game engine to render the boid objects, as well as handle some of the collision logic. The three basic boid rules were implemented, as well as some extra such as using ray tracing to avoid way collisions and steer out of the way, as well as limiting the field of view of other boids to encourage flock separation and splitting.

## 2. JavaScript
### Interactive To-Do List
![IN PROGRESS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-IN%20PROGRESS-orange)

Create an interactive to-do list web app. Features include adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking them as complete, and filtering tasks. Employ JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation and use local storage for persistence.

## 3. Rust
### CLI File Organiser
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Develop a command-line file organizer tool. It scans a directory, categorizes files by type, and moves them to respective subdirectories. Explore Rust's file handling and pattern matching capabilities.

## 4. PHP
### File Sharing Web App
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Build a simple file-sharing web application where users can upload and receive unique URLs for file downloads. This introduces file handling, unique ID generation, and basic PHP web development.

## 5. SQL
### Library management database
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Design a library management system database. Create tables for books, members, and loans, with complex SQL queries for searching books, issuing books, and alerting for late returns.

## 6. TypeScript
### Browser hosted puzzle game
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Develop a small browser-based puzzle game, like a matching game or a simple version of Tetris. Utilize TypeScript for managing game state, user input handling, and UI rendering.

## 7. C++
### ROS Project
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Initially began with [cpp-boid-generator](https://github.com/ITregear/cpp-boid-generator), attempting to simulate boids using c++. Decided that C# with Unity would be a better approach (for visualisation), and so will instead replace the c++ project with a yet to be determined ROS project, perhaps parallel manipulator kinematics based.

## 8. HTML/CSS
### Portfolio Website
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Design a responsive personal portfolio website, showcasing skills, projects, and experience. Employ modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid for responsive design.

## 9. Java (Android Studio)
### Note taking Android app
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Develop a basic Android app, such as a simple note-taking application. Design it to create, view, edit, and delete notes, and understand the basics of Android development and UI design in Android Studio.

## 10. R
### Unconfirmed data analysis project
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Conduct a detailed data analysis project using a dataset from Kaggle or similar. Perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and create visualizations for insights.

## 11. Perl
### Log File Analysis
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Write a script for log file analysis. The script should parse log files, extract key information like error codes or statistics, and generate a summarized report.

## 12. Go
### RESTful API Server
![TBD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-red)

Create a simple RESTful API server. The server can handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a resource, like notes or tasks. This will introduce you to Go's web server capabilities, handling HTTP requests, and JSON.
