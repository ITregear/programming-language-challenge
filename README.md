# programming-language-challenge
2024 Programming Language Challenge. Each month I will undertake a short project in a new language.

# Languages and Projects

The 12 planned projects are currently as follows. As they are completed, links to the respective repositories will be added.

## 1. JavaScript
### Interactive To-Do List
[TBD]

Create an interactive to-do list web app. Features include adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking them as complete, and filtering tasks. Employ JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation and use local storage for persistence.

## 2. Rust
### CLI File Organiser
[TBD]

Develop a command-line file organizer tool. It scans a directory, categorizes files by type, and moves them to respective subdirectories. Explore Rust's file handling and pattern matching capabilities.

## 3. PHP
### File Sharing Web App
[TBD]

Build a simple file-sharing web application where users can upload and receive unique URLs for file downloads. This introduces file handling, unique ID generation, and basic PHP web development.

## 4. SQL
### Library management database
[TBD]

Design a library management system database. Create tables for books, members, and loans, with complex SQL queries for searching books, issuing books, and alerting for late returns.

## 5. TypeScript
### Browser hosted puzzle game
[TBD]

Develop a small browser-based puzzle game, like a matching game or a simple version of Tetris. Utilize TypeScript for managing game state, user input handling, and UI rendering.

## 6. C++
### Fractal Generator
[cpp-boid-generator](https://github.com/ITregear/cpp-boid-generator)

Simple boid generator and simulator. Initially in 2D, and may be extended to 3D depending on complexity.

## 7. C#
### Windows weather app
[TBD]

Build a Windows weather application. Fetch real-time weather data from an API, displaying current conditions and forecasts using Windows Forms or WPF, handling JSON data and API requests.

## 8. HTML/CSS
### Portfolio Website
[TBD]

Design a responsive personal portfolio website, showcasing skills, projects, and experience. Employ modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid for responsive design.

## 9. Java (Android Studio)
### Note taking Android app
[TBD]

Develop a basic Android app, such as a simple note-taking application. Design it to create, view, edit, and delete notes, and understand the basics of Android development and UI design in Android Studio.

## 10. R
### Unconfirmed data analysis project
[TBD]

Conduct a detailed data analysis project using a dataset from Kaggle or similar. Perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and create visualizations for insights.

## 11. Perl
### Log File Analysis
[TBD]

Write a script for log file analysis. The script should parse log files, extract key information like error codes or statistics, and generate a summarized report.

## 12. Go
### RESTful API Server
[TBD]

Create a simple RESTful API server. The server can handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a resource, like notes or tasks. This will introduce you to Go's web server capabilities, handling HTTP requests, and JSON.
