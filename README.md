2024 Programming Language Challenge. Each month I will undertake a short project in a new language.

# Languages and Projects

The 12 planned projects are currently as follows. As they are completed, links to the respective repositories will be added.

JavaScript: Create an interactive to-do list web app. Features include adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking them as complete, and filtering tasks. Employ JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation and use local storage for persistence.

Rust: Develop a command-line file organizer tool. It scans a directory, categorizes files by type, and moves them to respective subdirectories. Explore Rust's file handling and pattern matching capabilities.

PHP: Build a simple file-sharing web application where users can upload and receive unique URLs for file downloads. This introduces file handling, unique ID generation, and basic PHP web development.

SQL: Design a library management system database. Create tables for books, members, and loans, with complex SQL queries for searching books, issuing books, and alerting for late returns.

TypeScript: Develop a small browser-based puzzle game, like a matching game or a simple version of Tetris. Utilize TypeScript for managing game state, user input handling, and UI rendering.

C++: Create a simple fractal generator, like rendering the Mandelbrot set, using complex numbers and iterating over pixel values. It's an introduction to graphics programming with C++.

C#: Build a Windows weather application. Fetch real-time weather data from an API, displaying current conditions and forecasts using Windows Forms or WPF, handling JSON data and API requests.

HTML/CSS: Design a responsive personal portfolio website, showcasing skills, projects, and experience. Employ modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid for responsive design.

Java (Android Studio): Develop a basic Android app, such as a simple note-taking application. Design it to create, view, edit, and delete notes, and understand the basics of Android development and UI design in Android Studio.

R: Conduct a detailed data analysis project using a dataset from Kaggle or similar. Perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and create visualizations for insights.

Perl: Write a script for log file analysis. The script should parse log files, extract key information like error codes or statistics, and generate a summarized report.

Go: Create a simple RESTful API server. The server can handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a resource, like notes or tasks. This will introduce you to Go's web server capabilities, handling HTTP requests, and JSON.
